### Project 1: [Data anomalies detection in Tax Payers](https://github.com/AntonyBoza/PROJECTS/blob/master/DETECCI%C3%93N%20TRANSACCIONES%20IRREGULARES.ipynb)
**Project Objective:**
To carry out an in-depth analysis of the data of regular tax payers in the Maracaibo city, during the first quarter of 2020 (January - March). To do this, we made use of descriptive statistical and predictive analysis techniques with the support of machine learning.


### Project 2: [Loan Risk Prediction for a web-based loan platform](https://github.com/AntonyBoza/PROJECTS/blob/master/LOAN_RISK_PREDICTION_CRIPTO_WAKU_MODEL.ipynb)
[Click here to open de App](https://app-risk-1.herokuapp.com/)

**Project Objective:**
To develop a  machine learning model for the online prediction of financial risk and the determination of credits approval to persons and companies. The UI was built with Flask and Python and the Web Deployment using Heroku service. 


### Project 3: [Customer segmentation analysis](https://github.com/AntonyBoza/PROJECTS/blob/master/Clustering%20-%20Users%20Segmentation%20Analysis.ipynb)
**Project Objective:**
To carry out a survey analysis applying clustering technique to extract insights about the market tendency and to find potential target customers for an administrative and invoicing cloud-based software.


### Project 4: [Survey Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)](https://github.com/AntonyBoza/PROJECTS/blob/master/Analisis_Encuesta_Software.ipynb)
**Project Objective:**
To carry out an Exploratory Data Analysis of a survey using Python and to extract insights to understand the actual market share between the main companies in the area.


### Project 5: [Dogs breed prediction using Deep learning](https://github.com/AntonyBoza/DEEP-LEARNING/blob/master/Transfer_Learning_Exercise_MobileNet.ipynb)
**Project Objective:**
To build up a deep learning model to predict dogs breed using TensorFlow Hub and MobileNet v2 (transfer learning).
The input is a dog picture, the output is the dog breed.
